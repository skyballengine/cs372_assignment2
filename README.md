A project from Introduction to Computer Networks where skeleton code for an unreliable channel is provided with the following classes:

RDTLayer - Description:                                                                                                         
  The reliable data transfer (RDT) layer is used as a communication layer to resolve issues over an unreliable         
  channel. 

Segment - Description:
  The segment is a segment of data to be transferred on a communication channel.

UnreliableChannel - Description:
  This class is meant to be more of a blackbox but you are allowed to see the implementation. You are not allowed to
  change anything in this file. There is also no need to base your algorithms on this particular implementation. This class
  is the communication channels such as serverToClientChannel and clientToServerChannel.
